Welcome to Emacs Synergy, a new website (blog?) about Emacs and its Ecosystem.
In Emacs Synergy, I will try to explain how various features and packages work,
how they can benefit your workflow, and how you can leverage them in your next
package (if you're a package developer).  See [about](/about/) for more.
